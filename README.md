# GAIAXServiceSelfDescriptions
A collection of all Gaia-X self-descriptions of the services developed in the BMBF project FAIR Data Spaces.

The initial examples are directly reused from [what Gaia-X has created](https://w3id.org/gaia-x/core/) with the permission of their creators.

As there is a lot of dynamics in the Gaia-X Self-Description repository, we have only copied the minimum infrastructure over here.

You will find here:
- the ontology containing the required vocabulary terms,
- instances of the ontology, i.e., concrete self-descriptions,
- validation shapes to validate the instances against (as the ontology itself doesn't suffice for this task)
